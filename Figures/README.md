# Figure Generation

The code in this folder generates the figures in the paper based after inference is performed. The procedure to generate figures is as follows.

## Main Figures

| Figure   | Code Used                                                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Figure-1 | Generated mostly in Power Point but a small part is generated by  `Figure-1.py` |
| Figure-2 | Figs 2A, 2B Generated by `Fig2AB-FigS4.py` and Figs 2C, 2D generated by `All_IMM150_Plots.py` |
| Figure-3 | Figs 3A, 3B, 3D Generated by `Fig3ABD-TMA-Grade-Stage-OS.py` and Fig. 3C generated by `Fig3C-BAP1-PBRM1.py` |
| Figure-4 | Fig 4A generated by `Fig4A-TKI-UTSW-Response.py` and Fig2 4B,4C,4D generated by `All_IMM150_Plots.py` |

## Supplementary Figures

| Figure S-3  | `FigS3-CD31-IHC-HNE-3-Images.py` generates S3A, S3B, S3C figures. |
| Figure S-4  | `Fig2AB-FigS4.py` generates the Figure                       |
| Figure S-5  | `FigS5-8-images.py` generates the Figure                     |
| Figure S-6  | `All_IMM150_Plots.py` generates the Figure                   |
| Figure S-7  | `FigS7-Pilot-Ph1-Cd31.py` generates the Figure               |
| Figure S-8  | `All_IMM150_Plots.py` generates the Figure                   |
| Figure S-9  | `FigS9-TMA_TumSize-Sarcomatoid.py` generates the Figure      |
| Figure S-10 | `FigS10-ArchPattern-PctPos.py` generates the Figure          |
| Figure S-11 | `FigS11-TCGA-OSurvival.py` generates the Figure              |
| Figure S-12 | `All_IMM150_Plots.py` generates the Figure                   |
| Figure S-13 | `All_IMM150_Plots.py` generates the Figure                   |
| Figure S-14 | `All_IMM150_Plots.py` generates the Figure                   |

# Tabular Data Generation

## All_IMM150_CrossValidation_Results.py 

This File generates and prints all therapy response results. It loopes over model results for all 3 folds and prints results.
